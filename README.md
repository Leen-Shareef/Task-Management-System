# Task-Management-System
# Description:
This project implements a Task Management System using various data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and ArrayLists. The system allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks based on due dates, urgency, and categories. It also supports sorting tasks, marking tasks as completed, and viewing urgent tasks. The system is designed to help users prioritize tasks efficiently and manage their time effectively.

# Key Features:
Task Management: Add, delete, and retrieve tasks using Linked Lists.
Urgent Tasks: Manage urgent tasks using a Stack (LIFO).
Completed Tasks: Track completed tasks using a Queue (FIFO).
Task Sorting: Sort tasks by due dates and categories using Selection Sort.
Error Handling: Robust error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.
User Interaction: Interactive command-line interface for task management.
